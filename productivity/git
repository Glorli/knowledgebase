You have your directory with all your code or files or whatever you want.
To make that directory a repository you go into it and:
	git init
To add your user name and email to the git repository
	git config --global user.name 'First LastName'
	git config --global user.email 'email@address.com'
To add a file called index.html to the repository
	git add index.html
To view what is in your staging area
	git status
This shows a file that needs to be committed
To remove this file from the staging area
	git rm --cached <file>
You could also add several files
	git add *.html
To add everything in the directory to staging
	git add .
To commit (add all changed files to the GitHub repository)
	git commit
	<ESC>
	:wq
Now a git status would tell you that none were ready to be committed
To commit changes with a comment (this will keep it from going into vim to make a comment)
	git commit -m 'Changed app.js'
To specify a file that shouldn't get included in any commit
	touch .gitignore
	edit the file and list the filenames to exclude (like logs)
New directories and all files in them will be added with 'git add .'

Branches
You can create a branch, make changes and commit but it won't be committed to the main branch
When you run git status it will say that you are on the master branch
To create a branch called login
	git branch login
This creates the branch but doesn't move you to it.  To move to a new branch
	git checkout login
To merge the code from the 'login' branch to the master branch
	git merge login

Remote repository
Accounts in Git Hub are free
	Create new in the upper-right hand of the GitHub page
	name the GitHub repository
	description and access setting
	Create repository
After committing changes locally
	git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryName>.git
	git push -u origin master
To list remote repositories for a local repository
	git remote
You can create a README.md (it's in markdown)
Once the origin is setup you can push with
	git push
The README.md will be displayed as the description/documentation window in the repository's page on GitHub
If you delete files in the local repository you have to commit the delete with:
	git commit -a -m 'A file was deleted'
	git push

Clone
If someone wants to get the repository you just click "Clone or download" button in GitHub
This lets you download as a zip or you can copy the link and
	git clone <URL_copied_from_GitHub>
If you had multiple developers working on a project and one of the developers made a change the other developers could update their copies with
	git pull
